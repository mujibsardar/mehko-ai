# 🧪 Testing Guide for Beginners

Welcome to testing! This guide will explain how testing works in our project in the simplest way possible.

## 🤔 What is Testing?

Think of testing like **proofreading an essay** before turning it in. You want to make sure everything works correctly before other people use your code.

**Without testing**: Your app might break when users try to use it
**With testing**: You catch problems before users ever see them

## 🏗️ Our Testing Setup

We use **two types of testing**:

### 1. Unit Tests (Fast & Simple) ✅
- **What**: Test individual pieces of code (like a single function or component)
- **Speed**: Very fast (2-3 seconds)
- **Tools**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Location**: `tests/unit/` folder

### 2. E2E Tests (Slow & Complete) 🐌
- **What**: Test the entire app like a real user would
- **Speed**: Slower (2-5 minutes)
- **Tools**: Playwright
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/` folder

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Run Unit Tests (Recommended for beginners)
```bash
# Run all unit tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (automatically re-runs when you change code)
npm run test:watch
```

### Run E2E Tests (Advanced)
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## 📁 What We Test

### Components (UI pieces)
- **ApplicationCard**: Shows application information
- **ApplicationOverview**: Shows detailed application view
- **Other components**: Each piece of the user interface

### Hooks (Logic pieces)
- **useAuth**: Handles user login/logout
- **useProgress**: Tracks user progress through applications

## 🎯 Test Results Explained

When you run tests, you'll see something like this:

```
✓ tests/unit/components/ApplicationCard.test.jsx (10 tests) 108ms
✓ tests/unit/hooks/useAuth.test.jsx (10 tests) 54ms
✓ tests/unit/hooks/useProgress.test.jsx (15 tests) 68ms

Test Files  5 passed (5)
Tests      48 passed (48)
```

**What this means**:
- ✅ **5 passed**: 5 test files ran successfully
- ✅ **48 passed**: 48 individual tests passed
- **0 failed**: No tests broke

## 🔧 Writing Your First Test

Here's a super simple example. Let's say you have a function that adds two numbers:

```javascript
// math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Here's how you'd test it:

```javascript
// math.test.js
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { add } from './math';

describe('add function', () => {
  it('should add two positive numbers', () => {
    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });

  it('should add negative numbers', () => {
    expect(add(-1, -2)).toBe(-3);
  });
});
```

**Breaking it down**:
- `describe`: Groups related tests together
- `it`: Describes what one test is checking
- `expect`: What you expect the result to be
- `toBe`: Checks if the result matches exactly

## 🚨 Common Test Failures

### 1. **Import Errors**
```
Error: Cannot find module './Component'
```
**Fix**: Check the file path and make sure the file exists

### 2. **Component Not Found**
```
Error: Unable to find element with text: "Submit Button"
```
**Fix**: Make sure the text you're looking for actually exists in your component

### 3. **Async Issues**
```
Error: Expected element to be in document but it wasn't
```
**Fix**: Use `waitFor()` when testing things that take time to load

## 💡 Testing Best Practices

### ✅ **DO**
- Test what your code **actually does**, not what you wish it did
- Write simple, clear test descriptions
- Test one thing at a time
- Use meaningful test data

### ❌ **DON'T**
- Test things that don't exist
- Write overly complex tests
- Test implementation details (test behavior instead)
- Ignore failing tests

## 🆘 Getting Help

### When Tests Fail
1. **Read the error message** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Check the test file** - see what the test is expecting
3. **Check your component** - make sure it does what the test expects
4. **Ask for help** - testing can be tricky at first!

### Useful Commands
```bash
# See detailed test output
npm test -- --reporter=verbose

# Run just one test file
npm test tests/unit/components/MyComponent.test.jsx

# Run tests with coverage (shows how much code is tested)
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Now you know the basics of testing! Start with:
1. **Run existing tests**: `npm test` (make sure they all pass)
2. **Try watch mode**: `npm run test:watch` (see tests run as you code)
3. **Write a simple test** for a function you create

Remember: **Testing is a skill that gets easier with practice**. Don't worry if it feels overwhelming at first - everyone feels that way when they start testing!

## 📚 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:
- Learn about [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Explore [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/)
- Practice writing tests for simple functions
- Ask questions when you get stuck!

**Happy Testing! 🧪✨**
