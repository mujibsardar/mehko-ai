# AI Application JSON Generation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for AI agents to generate JSON files for new county MEHKO applications. Follow the exact structure below to create working applications.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PDF STEPS ARE REQUIRED

**Every MEHKO application MUST have PDF steps for forms users need to fill out.**

## JSON Structure (Follow Exactly)

```json
{
  "id": "county_name_mehko",
  "title": "County Name MEHKO",
  "description": "Brief description with key limits and fees",
  "rootDomain": "county.gov",
  "supportTools": { "aiEnabled": true, "commentsEnabled": true },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step_id",
      "title": "Step Title",
      "type": "info|pdf",
      "action_required": true|false,
      "fill_pdf": true|false,
      "content": "Step content in plain text",
      "searchTerms": ["search phrase 1", "search phrase 2"],
      "formId": "FORM_ID_HERE", // Required for PDF steps only
      "pdfUrl": "https://county.gov/forms/form.pdf", // Required for PDF steps only
      "appId": "county_name_mehko" // Must match the main ID
    }
  ]
}
```

## Content Guidelines

### Step Content Structure (Plain Text Only)

  ],
  "appId": "county_name_mehko"
}
```

## Research Requirements

### What to Research for Each County:

- **Meal limits:** Daily and weekly maximums
- **Annual fees:** Current permit costs
- **Restrictions:** What's not allowed (e.g., signage, delivery, raw milk)
- **Requirements:** Specific certifications or approvals needed
- **Contact info:** Phone numbers, office locations, website
- **PDF forms:** Direct download links for SOP and permit applications
- **External references:** Website mentions, FAQ references, and other resources users can visit

### Where to Find Information:

- County Environmental Health website
- County Public Health department
- MEHKO program pages
- Fee schedules
- Contact directories

### How to Handle External References:

When writing "Where/how" sections, you can include statements like:
- "Visit [County Name]'s MEHKO webpage and FAQ"
- "Check the county website for current fee schedules"
- "Go to the Environmental Health department website for forms"

**The frontend will automatically detect these references and provide:**
- üåê **Visit Website** button (opens county website)
- üîç **Search Google** button (searches for more information)

This keeps your JSON simple while providing users with actionable ways to get more information.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing PDF steps** - Every application needs them
- **Generic content** - Make it county-specific
- **Broken links** - Test pdfUrl links before including
- **Wrong field types** - Use correct boolean values (true/false, not "true"/"false")
- **Missing appId** - Every step must have it
- **Markdown in content** - Use plain text only
- **Empty searchTerms** - Always include relevant search phrases

## Notes

- **Keep it simple:** No complex nesting, subSteps, or advanced features
- **PDF steps required:** Every application needs SOP and Permit Application steps
- **Include working download links:** Users need to access actual forms
- **Plain text content:** No markdown, no special formatting, no bold/italic
- **Follow the template exactly:** Use the structure shown above
- **Validate thoroughly:** Use the checklist before providing final JSON

**Remember: PDF steps are not optional - they are essential for a functional MEHKO application. Without them, users cannot complete the required forms.**
