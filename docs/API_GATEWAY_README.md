# 🚀 API Gateway Solution

## **What This Solves**

The API Gateway eliminates the proxy configuration issues you were experiencing with Vite. Instead of fighting with proxy settings, you now have a **single, unified entry point** that intelligently routes requests to both backends.

## **How It Works**

```
Frontend (Port 3001) → API Gateway → Routes to appropriate backend
                                    ├── Python (FastAPI) on port 8000
                                    └── Node.js on port 3000
```

## **🚀 Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Use Existing Scripts (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start all services including the gateway
./scripts/start-all-services.sh

# Check status
./scripts/status-all-services.sh

# Test the gateway
./scripts/test-gateway.sh

# Stop all services
./scripts/stop-all-services.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Start**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Python backend
cd python && python -m uvicorn server.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Start Node.js backend  
node server.js

# Terminal 3: Start API Gateway
node scripts/api-gateway.js

# Terminal 4: Start frontend
npm run dev
```

## **🌐 Access Points**

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 (served by API Gateway)
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:3001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/health
- **Python Backend**: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (direct access)
- **Node.js Backend**: http://localhost:3000 (direct access)

## **🔧 API Routing**

The gateway automatically routes requests based on endpoint patterns:

### **Node.js Backend (Port 3000)**
- `/api/ai-chat` → AI chat functionality
- `/api/ai-analyze-pdf` → PDF analysis
- `/api/form-fields` → Form field management
- `/api/fill-pdf` → PDF filling

### **Python Backend (Port 8000)**
- `/api/apps` → Application management
- `/api/process-county` → County processing

## **✅ Benefits**

1. **No More Proxy Issues** - Gateway handles all routing
2. **Single Frontend URL** - Everything accessible via port 3001
3. **Easy Debugging** - Clear routing logs in gateway
4. **Production Ready** - Same architecture for development and production
5. **Integrated Management** - Works with your existing server scripts

## **🧪 Testing**

Test the gateway is working:
```bash
./scripts/test-gateway.sh
```

## **📝 Configuration**

The frontend automatically uses the gateway via `src/config/api.js`. No changes needed to your React components!

## **🔄 Migration**

- **Old**: Frontend made requests to different ports
- **New**: Frontend makes all requests to port 3001, gateway routes appropriately

## **🚨 Troubleshooting**

### **Gateway Won't Start**
- Check if ports 3000 and 8000 are available
- Ensure both backends are running
- Check logs: `tail -f logs/gateway.log`

### **Routing Issues**
- Verify both backends are healthy
- Check gateway logs for routing errors
- Use `./scripts/test-gateway.sh` to diagnose

### **Port Conflicts**
- Use `./scripts/stop-all-services.sh` to clean up
- Check what's using the ports: `lsof -i :3001`

## **💡 Pro Tips**

1. **Always use the scripts** - They handle proper startup order
2. **Check gateway health first** - If gateway is down, nothing works
3. **Monitor logs** - Use `./scripts/watch-logs.sh` to see all services
4. **Test incrementally** - Start with health check, then test specific endpoints

**🎉 You now have a robust, maintainable API architecture that eliminates proxy headaches!**
