MEHKO.ai JSON GENERATOR # AI Application JSON Generation Guide ## Overview This guide provides instructions for AI agents to generate JSON files for new county MEHKO applications. Follow the exact structure below to create working applications. ## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PDF STEPS ARE REQUIRED **Every MEHKO application MUST have PDF steps for forms users need to fill out.** ## JSON Structure (Follow Exactly)
json
{
  "id": "county_name_mehko",
  "title": "County Name MEHKO",
  "description": "Brief description with key limits and fees",
  "rootDomain": "county.gov",
  "supportTools": { "aiEnabled": true, "commentsEnabled": true },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step_id",
      "title": "Step Title",
      "type": "info|pdf",
      "action_required": true|false,
      "fill_pdf": true|false,
      "content": "Step content with markdown formatting support",

      "appId": "county_name_mehko" // Must match the main ID
    }
  ]
}
## Content Structure Every step should follow this exact format:
**What to do:** [Clear action description]

**Why it matters:** [Brief explanation of importance]

**What you need:**
- ‚òê [Requirement 1]
- ‚òê [Requirement 2] 
- ‚òê [Requirement 3]

**Where/how:** [Instructions on how to complete - can include website references]

**Cost & time:** [Cost] ¬∑ [Time estimate]

**Ready when:** [Clear completion criteria]
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Step References in "What you need"** When referencing other steps in the "What you need" section, use this format: **‚ùå WRONG (Poor UX):** - ‚òê SOP form ‚Äî see Step sop_form - ‚òê Health Permit Application ‚Äî see Step permit_application_form **‚úÖ CORRECT (Good UX):** - ‚òê SOP form ‚Äî go to Step 4: Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) - ‚òê Health Permit Application ‚Äî go to Step 5: Health Permit Application **Step Reference Rules:** 1. **Always use "go to Step X: [Step Title]"** format 2. **Include the step number** (e.g., "Step 4") 3. **Include the full step title** (e.g., "Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)") 4. **Make it clear it's a clickable action** with "go to" 5. **Never use internal step IDs** like "sop_form" or "permit_application_form" **Example of Good Step References:**
json
"What you need:\n- ‚òê SOP form ‚Äî go to Step 4: Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)\n- ‚òê Health Permit Application ‚Äî go to Step 5: Health Permit Application\n- ‚òê CFPM certificate (from Step 2: Approvals & Training)\n- ‚òê Government ID and basic business info"
**Note:** For "Where/how" sections, you can include statements like "Visit [County Name]'s MEHKO webpage" or "Check the county website for current fees." The frontend will automatically detect these references and provide action buttons for visiting the website and searching for more information. ### Search Terms - **Use searchTerms array** - never put search terms in content - **Include county name** for local specificity - **Keep phrases under 60 characters** - **Focus on what users would actually search for** ## Step Types ### 1. Info Steps - **Purpose:** Provide information and instructions - **Content:** Use the standard structure above with markdown formatting - **fill_pdf:** Always false - **Required fields:** id, title, type, action_required, fill_pdf, content, searchTerms, appId - **Optional fields:** None **Markdown Formatting Support:** - **text** ‚Üí Bold text (use for section headers) - *text* ‚Üí Italic text (use sparingly for emphasis) - ` text ‚Üí Code/inline text (use for technical terms) ### 2. PDF Steps ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED - **Purpose:** Forms users need to fill out - **Content:** Explain what the form is for - **fill_pdf:** Always true - **Required fields:** id, title, type, action_required, fill_pdf, content, searchTerms, appId, formId, pdfUrl ## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED PDF STEPS ### Every Application Must Have: 1. **SOP Form Step:**

**Note:** The "Where/how" section includes "Visit the county website for approved course providers" - the frontend will automatically detect this and provide action buttons for website access and search functionality. ## Research Requirements ### What to Research for Each County: - **Meal limits:** Daily and weekly maximums - **Annual fees:** Current permit costs - **Restrictions:** What's not allowed (e.g., signage, delivery, raw milk) - **Requirements:** Specific certifications or approvals needed - **Contact info:** Phone numbers, office locations, website - **PDF forms:** Direct download links for SOP and permit applications - **External references:** Website mentions, FAQ references, and other resources users can visit ### üîç **Detailed Research Requirements:** #### **Fee Information (Be Specific):** - Initial application fee (exact dollar amount) - Annual permit fee (exact dollar amount) - Plan check fees (per hour or flat rate) - Inspection fees (if separate from application) - Any current waivers, subsidies, or special programs - Payment methods accepted #### **Contact Information (Actual Details):** - Phone number (main office) - Office address and hours of operation - Email contact (if available) - Website for current information - Department name and contact person (if available) #### **Submission Methods (Specific Options):** - Online submission (URL if available) - Mail submission (complete address) - In-person submission (office location) - Required documents list - Any special submission requirements #### **Timeline Information (Realistic Estimates):** - Application processing time (weeks/months) - Inspection scheduling time (how far in advance) - Permit issuance time (after inspection) - Any seasonal delays or restrictions - Renewal timeline and requirements ### Where to Find Information: - County Environmental Health website - County Public Health department - MEHKO program pages - Fee schedules - Contact directories ### üîç **Step-by-Step Research Process:** 1. **Start with the county's main website** (e.g., orangecounty.gov) 2. **Navigate to Environmental Health or Public Health section** 3. **Search for "MEHKO" or "Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations"** 4. **Look for dedicated MEHKO program pages** 5. **Find and download the required PDF forms:** - SOP Form (Standard Operating Procedures) - Permit Application Form 6. **Extract direct download links** from the website 7. **Test each PDF link** to ensure it downloads properly 8. **Gather fee information** from fee schedules or program pages 9. **Find contact information** for the department 10. **Note any specific restrictions or requirements** mentioned ### How to Handle External References: When writing "Where/how" sections, you can include statements like: - "Visit [County Name]'s MEHKO webpage and FAQ" - "Check the county website for current fee schedules" - "Go to the Environmental Health department website for forms" **The frontend will automatically detect these references and provide:** - üåê **Visit Website** button (opens county website) - üîç **Search Google** button (searches for more information) This keeps your JSON simple while providing users with actionable ways to get more information. ## Common Mistakes to Avoid - **Missing PDF steps** - Every application needs them - **Generic content** - Make it county-specific - **Broken links** - Test pdfUrl links before including - **Wrong field types** - Use correct boolean values (true/false, not "true"/"false") - **Missing appId** - Every step must have it - **Missing markdown formatting** - Use **text** for section headers to ensure proper parsing - **Empty searchTerms** - Always include relevant search phrases - **Incorrect step references** - Use "go to Step X: Title" format, not internal IDs ## üöÄ **Content Quality Improvements** ### **Instead of Generic Statements, Use Specific Information:** ‚ùå **Generic (Poor):** - "See county website for fees" - "Contact the department for information" - "Submit according to instructions" - "Timeline varies by case" ‚úÖ **Specific (Excellent):** - "Initial fee: $150, Annual permit: $75" - "Phone: (555) 123-4567, Office: 123 Health St, Hours: Mon-Fri 8AM-5PM" - "Submit online at county.gov/mehko, by mail to [address], or in-person at [location]" - "Processing: 2-3 weeks, Inspection: 1-2 weeks after approval, Permit: 1 week after inspection" ### **Always Include:** - **Exact dollar amounts** for all fees - **Complete contact information** (phone, address, hours) - **Specific submission options** (online, mail, in-person) - **Realistic timeline estimates** (weeks/months, not "varies") - **County-specific restrictions** and requirements - **Working website links** and form URLs ## üí° **Quick Quality Tips** ### **FormId Accuracy:** - Use the **exact filename** from the PDF (e.g., "MEHKO_PublicHealthPermitApplication-ENG") - Don't simplify or remove suffixes unless you're certain they're not needed ### **Search Terms Best Practices:** - **Never include emails** in search terms - put them in content instead - **Use specific phrases** users would actually search for - **Include current year** for fee-related searches (e.g., "MEHKO fees 2025") - **Keep under 60 characters** for better search results ### **Content Specificity:** - **Replace "visit website"** with actual contact methods (phone, email, office location) - **Replace "see fee schedule"** with actual dollar amounts - **Replace "timeline varies"** with realistic estimates (e.g., "2-3 weeks") - **Replace "check instructions"** with specific submission methods ## Notes - **Keep it simple:** No complex nesting, subSteps, or advanced features - **PDF steps required:** Every application needs SOP and Permit Application steps - **Include working download links:** Users need to access actual forms - **Use markdown formatting:** Use **text** for section headers, *text* for emphasis, text for code/technical terms - **Follow the template exactly:** Use the structure shown above - **Validate thoroughly:** Use the checklist before providing final JSON - **Section headers matter:** The app parses **What to do:**, **Why it matters:**, etc. to create structured content **Remember: PDF steps are not optional - they are essential for a functional MEHKO application. Without them, users cannot complete the required forms.** { "id": "example_county_mehko", "title": "Example County MEHKO", "description": "Example County MEHKO permit application with improved formatting and clearer step references.", "rootDomain": "examplecounty.gov", "supportTools": { "aiEnabled": true, "commentsEnabled": true }, "steps": [ { "id": "planning_overview", "title": "Plan Your MEHKO", "type": "info", "action_required": false, "fill_pdf": false, "content": "**What to do:** Review the MEHKO program overview and understand the requirements.\n\n**Why it matters:** Understanding the program helps you prepare properly and avoid delays.\n\n**What you need:**\n- ‚òê Basic understanding of MEHKO rules\n- ‚òê Kitchen setup assessment\n- ‚òê Menu planning ideas\n\n**Where/how:** Review county MEHKO overview; visit the county website for current information.\n\n**Cost & time:** $0 ¬∑ 15‚Äì30 minutes\n\n**Ready when:** You understand the basic requirements and have a plan for your operation.", "searchTerms": [ "Example County MEHKO overview", "Example County Home Kitchen Operations", "Example County MEHKO requirements" ], "appId": "example_county_mehko" }, { "id": "approvals_training", "title": "Approvals & Training", "type": "info", "action_required": true, "fill_pdf": false, "content": "**What to do:** Get required approvals and complete food safety training.\n\n**Why it matters:** These are mandatory requirements that must be completed before applying.\n\n**What you need:**\n- ‚òê CFPM certificate (ANSI-CFP recognized)\n- ‚òê Landlord/HOA approval (if renting)\n- ‚òê City business license (if required)\n\n**Where/how:** Take an ANSI-approved CFPM course; check local business license requirements.\n\n**Cost & time:** $150‚Äì300 for CFPM ¬∑ 2‚Äì4 weeks\n\n**Ready when:** You have your CFPM certificate and all required approvals.", "searchTerms": [ "Example County CFPM training", "Example County business license", "Example County MEHKO approvals" ], "appId": "example_county_mehko" }, { "id": "prepare_docs", "title": "Prepare Required Documents", "type": "info", "action_required": true, "fill_pdf": false, "content": "**What to do:** Gather the documents you'll submit with your application.\n\n**Why it matters:** Incomplete submissions delay approval and inspection.\n\n**What you need:**\n- ‚òê SOP form ‚Äî go to Step 4: Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)\n- ‚òê Health Permit Application ‚Äî go to Step 5: Health Permit Application\n- ‚òê CFPM certificate (from Step 2: Approvals & Training)\n- ‚òê Government ID and basic business info\n\n**Where/how:** Organize files (PDFs/photos) for upload or printing.\n\n**Cost & time:** $0 ¬∑ 30‚Äì60 minutes\n\n**Ready when:** All documents are filled/signed and stored as PDFs.", "searchTerms": [ "Example County MEHKO SOP requirements", "Example County MEHKO application documents", "Example County Home Kitchen Operations forms" ], "appId": "example_county_mehko" }, { "id": "sop_form", "title": "Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)", "type": "pdf", "formId": "EXAMPLE_MEHKO_SOP-English", "pdfUrl": "https://examplecounty.gov/forms/mehko-sop.pdf", "appId": "example_county_mehko", "action_required": true, "fill_pdf": true, "content": "**What to do:** Fill the MEHKO SOP form covering menu, preparation, storage, and sanitation.\n\n**Why it matters:** This shows the county how you will keep food safe at home.\n\n**What you need:**\n- ‚òê Menu and ingredients list\n- ‚òê Prep/cooking/cooling/holding details\n- ‚òê Cleaning/sanitizing plan; handwashing setup\n\n**Where/how:** Complete the SOP form in this step.\n\n**Cost & time:** $0 ¬∑ 30‚Äì60 minutes\n\n**Ready when:** SOP is complete and consistent with your operation.", "searchTerms": [ "Example County MEHKO SOP template", "Example County food safety SOP requirements", "MEHKO Standard Operating Procedures Example County" ] }, { "id": "permit_application_form", "title": "Health Permit Application", "type": "pdf", "formId": "EXAMPLE_MEHKO_PermitApplication", "pdfUrl": "https://examplecounty.gov/forms/mehko-permit.pdf", "appId": "example_county_mehko", "action_required": true, "fill_pdf": true, "content": "**What to do:** Complete the county Health Permit Application for a Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation.\n\n**Why it matters:** This is the official request to operate a MEHKO.\n\n**What you need:**\n- ‚òê Owner contact and site address\n- ‚òê CFPM certificate details\n- ‚òê SOP ‚Äî go to Step 4: Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)\n\n**Where/how:** Complete the application in this step.\n\n**Cost & time:** $0 to fill ¬∑ 15‚Äì30 minutes\n\n**Ready when:** Application is complete and matches your SOP.", "searchTerms": [ "Example County MEHKO permit application", "Example County Health Permit Application form", "Example County Home Kitchen Operations application" ] } ] }
