# 🤖 AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST!

## 🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST READ AND FOLLOW THESE RULES

**BEFORE making ANY changes to this project, you MUST:**

1. **📖 READ ALL RULES** in `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. **❓ ASK PERMISSION** before any code changes
3. **📋 EXPLAIN CHANGES** before proceeding
4. **⏸️ WAIT FOR APPROVAL** before executing

## 🚫 NEVER DO THIS
- ❌ Make changes without permission
- ❌ Assume changes are approved
- ❌ Skip reading the rules
- ❌ Proceed without explanation
- ❌ Create files in project root

## 📋 Required Workflow

```
🔧 PROPOSED CHANGES:
├── File: [filename]
├── Action: [create/modify/delete]
├── Purpose: [why this change is needed]
├── Impact: [what this will affect]
└── Risk Level: [low/medium/high]

❓ May I proceed with these changes?
```

## 📚 Read These Files First
- `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Project-level AI instructions
- `.cursor/rules/README.md` - Overview of all rules
- `.cursor/rules/05-code-changes.md` - Code change requirements
- `.cursor/rules/02-git-workflow.md` - Git workflow
- `.cursor/rules/01-file-organization.md` - File organization
- `.cursor/rules/03-state-checking.md` - State verification
- `.cursor/rules/04-server-management.md` - Server management

## ✅ After Changes
1. Pause and ask: "Are you ready to commit these changes?"
2. Wait for user to test changes first
3. Never use `git add .` immediately
4. Always explain what was changed

## 🆘 Emergency Protocol
Even in critical situations:
1. Explain the urgency
2. Ask for permission
3. Explain risks of not acting
4. Get explicit approval
